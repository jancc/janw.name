Hi! I'm Jan.

Computer scientist and currently a PhD candidate at the [Human-Computer
Interaction Group](https://hci.uni-hannover.de/) at the [Leibniz
University](https://www.uni-hannover.de/) in Hanover, Germany. My field of
research is Human-Computer Interaction. Specifically, I want to bridge the gap
between designs that are easy-to-learn and those that enable autonomous
learning of the systems beneath them. I additionally work on the topic of
environmentally friendly computing and the application of HCI principles to
drive societal change towards a more sustainable future. At best, I envision
developments that enable a true digital permaculture, in which every device is
reprogrammable and repairable to massively curb the energy requirements of
hardware production.

In my free time I sometimes create computer
[games](https://klockenschooster.de/games.html) and other
[software](https://klockenschooster.de/tools.html). Source code can
be found on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/jancc) or my own
[cgit server](https://git.klockenschooster.de).
