<blockquote>
<p>During the event, those who wished to live moved into the maze of tunnels.</p>
<p>Once it was all over, some moved to the outside world once again.</p>
<p>This is the story of those who remained.</p>

Underlife is a unique blend between roguelike and story-driven experience.
Humanity had to move into an endless maze of underground tunnels after the
overworld became uninhabitable. You are living in the second underground
generation. Having never seen the overworld, your only desire is to survive
the cold hard life in the sunless caves...

Underlife features both procedural world generation and hand crafted story
fragments. So while no two worlds are the same, an overarching backstory
gives the gameworld a purpose.
