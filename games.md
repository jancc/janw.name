<summary>Cybernator</summary>
<p>
A top down shooter in which you battle through 4 levels. Your mission is to
save all the hostages in the level by bringing them to the "disconnection
station". The game never got its final polish and still lacks a real bossfight.
It is, however, quite playable already.

The story goes as follows: Some people got trapped in the cyber world and now
you, the Cybernator, have to help them.

<summary>Death Typer</summary>
<p>
A zombie shooter with a twist. Shooting requires you to type a text. Each
character of the text equals one fired bullet. But your two-hand typing
technique won't help you a bit! You'll also have to use your mouse to aim.
Can you type quickly enough with only one free hand?? Find it out in this
unique zombie shooter.

Originally made in 2013. Semi-Regularly updated to newer Unity versions.

<summary>Anti-Smoke Man</summary>
<p>
A 2D platformer in which you battle through levels filled with evil cigarettes.
The game was made as a school project for an anti-smoking competition.
There originally was music but I can't include it in the download because I'd
get sued. If you want the original feel, put on the [soundtrack to
Unreal Gold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IISjIMpepo) alongside the game.

Fun fact: The only reason you have a gun is that young me could not figure out
how to implement the Mario-like "jumping on heads" mechanic.

## very very old

<summary>Outer Earth Arena</summary>
<p>
It is basically asteroids. Still, its one of the first ever playable and fun
games I made.

FYI: There are to versions of the game. `oea_bin.exe` gives you the version
with audiere.dll powered music. `oea_web.exe` is slightly stripped and without
m√∫sic. The second one works better in Wine.

<summary>Raum Race</summary>
<p>
My oldest "game" for which I still have the original `.exe`. Your mission is to
protect a spaceship from the aliens moving about in space. Click on them to
make them disappear. If any alien touches your spaceship you loose points.

The original version was made in 2006. I slightly retouched it back in 2012.
If I remember correctly it was meant as a demo for a much more ambitious game.

Fun fact: 2012 and 2006 are less far apart than 2012 and now :)

<details>
<summary>Cue</summary>
<p>
Cue was a top down shooter. It kind of lives on in the Cybernator game, but it
had a much larger focus on platforming gameplay.

Fun fact: The models were UV mapped to exactly fit Minecraft skins. This was
done so that a SkinEdit tool could be repurposed for the game.

<summary>Intermission</summary>
<p>
This was an abstract horror game. In fact, it was somewhat of an atmospheric
_walking simulator_ slightly before the term got used. The game featured all
the horror game tropes. It had basements, cityscapes with evil factories
looming in the background, derelict buildings and dream-like scenery.

<summary>Superblastroids</summary>
<p>
The first game I ever made. I WISH I'd still have a version of this around but
it seems to be lost forever. Back then I used _Game Maker 6_ for everything.
The game itself was a vertical scrolling space shooter. You had to fight your
way through an ever increasing amount of asteroids headed your way.

Maybe I'll get around to remake this game. Maybe even in Game Maker 6...

Fun fact: The name is ripped from some episode of _Fosters Home for Imaginary
Friends_.
